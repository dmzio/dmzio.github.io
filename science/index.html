                <p>
                    Growing number of experimental and theoretical method provides us a lot of <em>data</em> but we need a
                    <em>knowledge</em>. Methods of informatics and machine learning in chemistry helps us transform unmeaningful
                    numbers to valuable inferences.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Among broad range of cheminformatics tasks we are focusing on the:

                    <li>development of the chemical information systems</li>
                    <li>optimization of the pharmacophore-based workflows for the virtual screening</li>
                    <li>virtual screening of the chemical databases for the lead identification in drug discovery</li>

                <h3>Anion-radical salts as a functional materials <span class="label label-default">2002 - 2012</span></h3>
                <p>Developement and characterization of a new semiconducting and magnetic materials in order to use them in advanced devices.</p>
                <p>Main classes of compounds of interest includes anion- and cation-radical salts (primarily ARS of tetracynoquinodimethane),
                and transition-metal complexes with charge-transfer ligands.</p>
                <p>Many characterization methods are used in conjunction with the electronic structure calculations (DFT, post-HF methods) for
                describing of the electronic and magnetic effects in synthesized compounds.</p>
