	(TMTSF)2[3,3'-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)2], were performed using Raman and quantum
	chemical simulation methods. The polarized Raman spectra of single
	crystals of the salt were recorded in the range 150-3100�cm-1. An
	assignment of the strongest vibrational Raman lines was proposed.
	The possibility of the presence of two rotamers of the Co anion has
	been discussed taking into account the DFT calculations and the experimental
	spectra of the reference material.},

	vibrations of the CC bonds (mode [nu]4) were used for the evaluation
	of the charge density on the TCNQ- anions but the stretching vibrations
	of the CN bonds (mode [nu]2) indicate a diversity of the neighborhood
	of TCNQ species. It was shown that for the salts containing nonequivalent
	TCNQ anions the band [nu]2 is splitted; each component of the multiplet
	seen in the IR and Raman spectra represents various environment of
	the anion. On the other hand the splitted mode [nu]4 indicates an
	existence of TCNQ- anions differently charged. Thus, it was shown
	that the spectral methods are suitable for indicating nonequivalence
	of the TCNQ in their salts.},
